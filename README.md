## Summary of Data ##
- The average length of stay was 5.97 days. This was also shown on the histogram, which had the highest count for values between 0-10 days.
- The function I used to find descriptive stats for total charges gave me an issue. I tried eliminating the NaN or 0 rows, but the descriptive stats still showed '0' even though there was data in the CSV file. This also affected the boxplot, so I swapped out total charges with total cost.
- The average total cost was $742.21, which seemed off based on the numbers I previewed in the table. If there was an error in decimal placement, then it would make more sense to say the mean was $7,422.10.
- Based on the bar graph for Age Group Distribution, the age group 50-69 had the highest admission rate, followed by the age groups 70+ and 30-49.
- For Gender Distribution, females had a higher count than males.
- The most common type of admission was Emergency, regardless of age group category or gender.
